Given the task of training a quadruped robot for a variety of terrains both indoors and outdoors, certain parameters are more critical than others for domain randomization. Let's analyze each parameter's impact on the task:

1. **friction_range**: Different terrains will have varying friction coefficients. This parameter will significantly impact the robot's ability to move and stay stable, especially on slippery surfaces vs. rough terrains.

    ```python
    friction_range = [0.2, 0.9]
    ```

    - Reasoning: Allowing for a wide range of friction values will enable the robot to adapt to different terrains without making the task unrealistically hard.

2. **restitution_range**: Varies by surface when collisions occur (e.g., bouncing behavior). While interesting, it might not significantly impact running stability directly.

    ```python
    restitution_range = [0.2, 0.6]
    ```

    - Reasoning: Some variability is necessary to simulate different terrain responses but keeping the range moderate to maintain relevance to the primary running task.

3. **added_mass_range**: This simulates changes in the robot's load, which could happen due to carrying additional weight or changes in its own mass over time.

    ```python
    added_mass_range = [0.0, 3.0]
    ```

    - Reasoning: The robot should be able to adapt to carrying light additional loads but within a realistic limit that does not hinder its primary function of running.

4. **com_displacement_range**: This affects stability and maneuverability, representing potential shifts in the robot's center of mass.

    ```python
    com_displacement_range = [0.0, 0.1]  # Small changes to simulate carrying load or minor physical modifications.
    ```

    - Reasoning: While the center of mass might shift slightly in real scenarios, excessive shifts would not represent typical operational conditions.

5. **motor_strength_range**: The strength of the robot's motors can vary due to battery level or differences between individual motor performances.

    ```python
    motor_strength_range = [0.8, 1.5]
    ```

    - Reasoning: Training over a range allows for adaptability to different motor performances while ensuring the robot can achieve the target speed.

6. **Kp_factor_range** and **Kd_factor_range**: These relate to the control systems' proportional and derivative gains. Variation in these parameters simulates tuning the control system for different conditions.

    ```python
    Kp_factor_range = [1.0, 1.8]
    Kd_factor_range = [0.2, 1.5]
    ```

    - Reasoning: Allows the controller to adapt to a variety of conditions without overfitting to a single setting.

7. Parameters such as **dof_stiffness_range**, **dof_damping_range**, **dof_friction_range**, **dof_armature_range** are given fixed values, unlikely beneficial for randomization since they do not naturally vary across real-world conditions or do not significantly impact the primary task.

8. **push_vel_xy_range**: This simulates external forces acting on the robot, such as wind or collision with small objects.

    ```python
    push_vel_xy_range = [0.0, 2.0]  # Simulating minor external disturbances
    ```

    - Reasoning: Helps the robot to learn to stabilize and recover from small disturbances while running.

9. **gravity_range**: Gravity is constant on Earth; however, slight variations could simulate different terrains' inclines or declines and minor simulation inaccuracies.

    ```python
    gravity_range = [-0.2, 0.2]  # Small modifications to account for inclines or declines
    ```

    - Reasoning: While gravity itself won't change, altering this slightly can help simulate running up or downhill.

Here's the complete Python code configuring the chosen randomization ranges:

```python
# Domain Randomization Parameters for Quadruped Robot Training
friction_range = [0.2, 0.9]
restitution_range = [0.2, 0.6]
added_mass_range = [0.0, 3.0]
com_displacement_range = [0.0, 0.1]
motor_strength_range = [0.8, 1.5]
Kp_factor_range = [1.0, 1.8]
Kd_factor_range = [0.2, 1.5]
push_vel_xy_range = [0.0, 2.0]
gravity_range = [-0.2, 0.2]

# Parameters not used for randomization
# dof_stiffness_range = [0.1, 0.1]
# dof_damping_range = [0.01, 0.01]
# dof_friction_range = [0.01, 0.01]
# dof_armature_range = [0.01, 0.01]
```

This setup aims to provide a balanced domain randomization that helps the robot learn to adapt to a broad set of real-world conditions without making the learning task unnecessarily difficult.
