[2025-03-24 11:00:37,159][root][INFO] - Task description: To make the go1 quadruped run forward with a velocity of exactly 2.0 m/s in the positive x direction of the global coordinate frame. The policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be as steady and stable as possible with minimal action rate. Specifically, as it's running, the torso should remain near a z position of 0.34, and the orientation should be perpendicular to gravity. Also, the legs should move smoothly and avoid the DOF limits.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward (tensor with reward per environment)
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component (tensor with reward component per environment)
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (2) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Given the policy feedback, let's analyze each component and suggest improvements:

1. **Task Score Variation**: The variation in task scores suggests that the learning process is highly inconsistent. High maximum scores indicate that the policy can potentially achieve the desired objectives but fails to do so consistently. This inconsistency could stem from the reward function's design or external factors influencing learning.

2. **Episode Length discrepancies**: The wide range in episode lengths suggests variability in how effectively the policy performs across different episodes, which could relate to exploration strategies or the stability of learned behaviors.

3. **Action Smoothness**: The significant negative value of the action smoothness reward component suggests it might be penalizing too harshly, potentially discouraging the agent from taking the needed actions to improve. Reducing its weight might encourage more diverse movements.

4. **DOF Limit Penalty**: The negative values are expected as they represent penalties, but they vary less significantly in magnitude compared to other components. This suggests the limits imposed might be either too strict or not appropriately influencing behavior. Adjusting the penalization method or scale could help.

5. **Orientation and Z Position Rewards**: The orientation and Z position components show high values, suggesting they dominate the reward signal. However, their high values also indicate that the RL agent learns these tasks more effectively. Balancing their weights with other components might provide a more balanced learning process.

6. **Velocity Reward**: Given that desired velocity is a key task objective, its variance indicates it needs to be adjusted for better learning focus.

Let's recalibrate the reward components with these analyses in mind:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env
    
    # Updated weights for different parts of the reward
    velocity_weight = 2.0  # Increase emphasis on reaching desired velocity.
    z_pos_weight = 0.3  # Decrease based on performance; it's learning well but don't want it overemphasized.
    orientation_weight = 0.1  # Decrease weight due to high scores and less room for improvement.
    dof_limit_penalty_weight = 0.05  # Decrease harshness since it's not a primary focus.
    smoothness_weight = 0.05  # Significantly reduce to encourage more varied actions.
    
    desired_velocity_x = 2.0
    desired_z_pos = 0.34
    desired_orientation = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0., 1.], device=env.device)

    velocity_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 7] - desired_velocity_x)
    z_pos_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - desired_z_pos)
    orientation_error = 1 - torch.abs(torch.sum(env.base_quat * desired_orientation, dim=1))
    
    dof_limit_penalty = torch.sum(torch.relu(torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) - (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]).unsqueeze(0)/2), axis=1)
    
    action_smoothness = torch.mean(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Normalizing components to a similar scale
    reward = (velocity_weight * torch.exp(-velocity_error)) + \
             (z_pos_weight * torch.exp(-z_pos_error)) + \
             (orientation_weight * torch.exp(-orientation_error)) - \
             (dof_limit_penalty_weight * dof_limit_penalty) - \
             (smoothness_weight * action_smoothness)

    reward_components = {
        'velocity': velocity_weight * torch.exp(-velocity_error),
        'z_pos': z_pos_weight * torch.exp(-z_pos_error),
        'orientation': orientation_weight * torch.exp(-orientation_error),
        'dof_limit_penalty': -dof_limit_penalty_weight * dof_limit_penalty,
        'action_smoothness': -smoothness_weight * action_smoothness
    }

    return reward, reward_components
```

In this revised reward function:
- We adjusted the weights based on performance feedback to better balance the importance of each component.
- Introduced exponential decay for error based components (`velocity_error`, `z_pos_error`, `orientation_error`) to smooth rewards and provide stronger gradients for smaller errors, which should help with fine-tuning behavior.
- Adjusted penalties and rewards to focus on smooth, efficient movement while still encouraging the policy to meet the primary task objectives.

Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. **Task Score & Episode Length**: The increasing trend in task score and stable, high episode lengths indicate that the policy is gradually learning the task but might be doing so inefficiently or inconsistently. A Max task score of 306.10 suggests the policy has the potential to perform well, but with a Mean of 168.24, there's room for improvement in consistency.

2. **Action Smoothness**: The significant negative values and steadily decreasing trend suggest that this component is overly penalized. The high variance indicates it could be scaled down or adjusted for a softer impact, encouraging smoother actions without severely impacting the total reward.

3. **DOF Limit Penalty**: Given its consistent negative values and relatively small scale compared to other components, the penalty seems effective but could potentially be scaled to ensure it doesn't overshadow other important aspects of the reward.

4. **Orientation & Z Position Rewards**: These components show less variance compared to others and maintain high values, suggesting the policy learns these aspects well. However, to ensure a balanced learning focus, their scales might need adjustment to prevent them from dominating the reward signal.

5. **Velocity** and **Z Position**: Given their foundational role in achieving the task and their large variance in values, it's clear the reward function needs to better balance these components with others to emphasize efficient, forward movement and stable height maintenance without sacrificing smoothness or adherence to DOF limits.

Considering these insights, let's formulate an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env
    
    # Adjusted weights
    velocity_weight = 1.5
    z_pos_weight = 0.2
    orientation_weight = 0.15
    dof_limit_penalty_weight = 0.01
    smoothness_weight = 0.01
    
    # Objectives
    desired_velocity_x = 2.0
    desired_z_pos = 0.34
    desired_orientation = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0., 1.], device=env.device)

    # Calculations
    velocity_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 7] - desired_velocity_x)
    z_pos_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - desired_z_pos)
    orientation_error = 1 - torch.abs(torch.sum(env.base_quat * desired_orientation, dim=1))
    
    dof_limit_penalty = torch.sum(torch.relu(torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) - (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]).unsqueeze(0)/2), axis=1)
    
    action_smoothness = torch.mean(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Scoring
    velocity_score = velocity_weight * (1 - torch.tanh(velocity_error))
    z_pos_score = z_pos_weight * (1 - torch.tanh(z_pos_error))
    orientation_score = orientation_weight * (1 - torch.tanh(orientation_error))
    dof_limit_penalty_score = -dof_limit_penalty_weight * dof_limit_penalty
    smoothness_score = -smoothness_weight * action_smoothness
    
    total_reward = velocity_score + z_pos_score + orientation_score + dof_limit_penalty_score + smoothness_score

    reward_components = {
        'velocity': velocity_score,
        'z_pos': z_pos_score,
        'orientation': orientation_score,
        'dof_limit_penalty': dof_limit_penalty_score,
        'action_smoothness': smoothness_score
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

Changes:

- **Adopted a softer approach for action smoothness** by greatly reducing its weight, which should allow for more varied actions without heavily penalizing the score.
- **Scaled down the DOF limit penalty** to ensure it guides the policy without overly dominating the reward.
- **Introduced a non-linear (tanh) scaling** for velocity, z position, and orientation errors to reduce sensitivity to high errors and encourage finer control as the policy improves. This change aims to balance the reward components' impact, focusing on steady forward movement, stability, and efficient action usage.
- The overall rewards have been **balanced to focus on task achievement** while ensuring smooth and limit-adherent actions.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward (tensor with reward per environment)

Considering the policy feedback:

1. **Task Score & Episode Length**: Task score and episode lengths indicate the policy is learning, with both metrics showing significant growth. The increase in episode length reflects an improvement in survivability, while the task score's growth suggests that the policy is better fulfilling the task requirements over time.

2. **Action Smoothness**: The consistently large negative values for action smoothness indicate that the penalty might be too harsh or that the policy is struggling to achieve smooth actions. Given that smoothness is crucial for stability, especially in legged locomotion, adjusting its weight could offer a balance between encouraging smooth actions and not penalizing the policy too harshly.

3. **DOF Limit Penalty**: The magnitude of the DOF limit penalty is relatively small compared to other components, but its presence is essential to avoid extreme joint positions. A slight adjustment to its weight could still offer a guideline to the policy without overshadowing other components.

4. **Orientation Reward**: The orientation component demonstrates high values and less variance compared to other components, which suggests the policy adequately learns to maintain orientation. Given its consistently high values, its influence on the total reward is crucial but might need slight balancing adjustments.

5. **Velocity & Z Position Rewards**: The high variance seen in the rewards for velocity and Z position suggests these are pivotal, challenging aspects the policy is learning to optimize. Both components are integral to the task, indicating the policy is actively learning to regulate speed and maintain a stable z position.

Based on these insights, the following adjustments are proposed:

- **Rebalance the weights** to ensure no single component excessively dominates the total reward.
- **Adjust the scaling of action smoothness** to prevent overly harsh penalties, thus allowing more fluid movement without promoting jerky actions.
- **Maintain a focus on critical task components**—velocity and Z position—since these are directly related to the primary task objectives.
- **Fine-tuning the DOF limit penalty** considering its consistent low values, to ensure it guides behavior without unduly impacting the reward.

Improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env
    
    # Tweaked weights
    velocity_weight = 1.0
    z_pos_weight = 0.1
    orientation_weight = 0.05
    dof_limit_penalty_weight = 0.005
    smoothness_weight = 0.005

    desired_velocity_x = 2.0
    desired_z_pos = 0.34
    desired_orientation = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0., 1.], device=env.device)

    # Calculate errors
    velocity_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 7] - desired_velocity_x)
    z_pos_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - desired_z_pos)
    orientation_error = 1 - torch.abs(torch.sum(env.base_quat * desired_orientation, dim=1))
    
    dof_limit_penalty = torch.sum(torch.relu(torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) - (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]).unsqueeze(0)/2), dim=1)
    
    action_smoothness = torch.mean(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Rescale and compute scores
    velocity_score = velocity_weight * torch.exp(-velocity_error)
    z_pos_score = z_pos_weight * torch.exp(-z_pos_error)
    orientation_score = orientation_weight * torch.exp(-orientation_error)
    dof_limit_penalty_score = -dof_limit_penalty_weight * dof_limit_penalty
    smoothness_score = -smoothness_weight * action_smoothness
    
    # Total reward composition
    total_reward = velocity_score + z_pos_score + orientation_score + dof_limit_penalty_score + smoothness_score

    # Components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'velocity': velocity_score,
        'z_pos': z_pos_score,
        'orientation': orientation_score,
        'dof_limit_penalty': dof_limit_penalty_score,
        'action_smoothness': smoothness_score
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

Changes Made:

- **Exponential scoring** is used for velocity, z position, and orientation errors to soften the penalty for deviations and encourage precise control without penalizing the agent too harshly for small errors.
- **Weight adjustments**: Reduced the weight of action smoothness and DOF limit penalties. This adjustment aims to balance the reward components more evenly, ensuring consistency in policy learning across all task aspects.
- **Overall focus**: By rebalancing, the reward function aims to maintain a clear focus on the primary task objectives (velocity and z position) while ensuring the motion is smooth and within joint limits for robustness and real-world applicability.

    (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward (tensor with reward per environment)
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component (tensor with reward component per environment)
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (2) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
